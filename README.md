# Adventurer's Additions and Edits
  
## About
While I was working on additional patches through [my fork](https://github.com/Adventurer13/VABOrganizer-Sheepdog_AdventurerAdditions) for [VABOrganizer-Sheepdog](https://github.com/Sheepdog2142/VABOrganizer-Sheepdog) I came across issues in various mods. This is a collection of [ModuleManger](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager) patches to remedy those as I come across them for others to use. This also contains any additions I use or have created while playing Kerbal Space Program. Feel free to pick and choose, modify, or use all as you see fit.

## Features

## For Creators of KSP Mods
If there is anything in this collection you do not want or have integrated into your own mod—that I specifically patch or add—feel free to let me know *respectfully*. I have no problem removing such when reasonable.
